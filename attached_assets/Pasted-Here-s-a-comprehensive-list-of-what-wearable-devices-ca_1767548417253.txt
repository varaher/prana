Here’s a comprehensive list of what wearable devices capture, organized from basic to advanced:

🧠 Core Physiological Parameters

These are the fundamentals most wearables today can measure:

✅ Heart & Circulation

Heart Rate (HR) – beats per minute

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – beat-to-beat variation

Resting Heart Rate

Pulse Wave Velocity / Vascular Age (on some advanced devices)

✅ Activity & Movement

Step count

Distance traveled

Calories burned

Active minutes / activity intensity

Posture & movement patterns

✅ Sleep & Recovery

Total sleep duration

Sleep stages (light, deep, REM)

Sleep quality score

Sleep latency / wake after sleep onset

✅ Breathing & Respiration

Respiratory Rate (RR) – breaths per minute

Breathing patterns (periodic breathing detection)

❤️ Advanced Health & Medical Parameters
🩺 Cardiac & Rhythm

ECG (Electrocardiogram) – single-lead cardiac rhythm

Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) detection

Arrhythmia alerts

🧪 Blood Metrics

SpO₂ (Oxygen Saturation) – percentage of oxygen in blood

Pulse oximetry trend analysis

Estimated Blood Pressure (in some devices / algorithms)

🧠 Nervous System & Stress

Stress / Autonomic balance metrics via HRV patterns

Mindfulness / guided breathing suggestions

🧬 Metabolic / Body Metrics

Continuous skin temperature

Core or estimated body temperature spikes

VO₂ Max – cardiorespiratory fitness estimate

Energy expenditure (EPOC / exercise)

📊 Contextual & Behavioral Parameters

These help infer health or lifestyle patterns:

Sedentary alerts

Caffeine / water intake logging (paired app)

Menstrual cycle tracking (female health)

Skin conductance / electrodermal activity (stress, arousal)

🌍 Environmental Parameters

Some wearables include external sensors:

Ambient temperature

Barometric pressure

UV exposure

Altitude / elevation gain

Air quality index (AQI)

Noise / loud sound alerts

🔄 Smart & Contextual Metrics (Latest Updates)
🆕 AI-Driven & Predictive Metrics

Modern wearables are using ML/AI to generate:

Early illness detection (based on combined metrics like elevated HR, skin temp, disrupted sleep)

Respiratory irregularity alerts (possible COVID-like patterns)

Personal fitness age / training effect modeling

Recovery score (sleep + HRV + activity)

Stress resilience trends

🆕 Continuous BP Estimation

Some recent devices estimate blood pressure trends without a cuff using pulse transit time + machine learning.

🆕 Blood Glucose Prediction (Experimental)

Wearables are being tested to predict glucose trends using multisensor fusion (not FDA-approved widely yet), but some consumer devices give “glucose trend insights.”

🆕 Fall Detection & Emergency Alerts

Fall detection (accelerometer + gyroscope fusion)

SOS / crash detection alerts

Share live data with emergency contacts
